%	PERSONAL STATEMENT SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{rSection}{Personal Statement}
	
	My current focus in quantitative FX strategies and trading has helped me gain market experience which I have found important in idea generation for research. The strategies I currently run are non carry or trend-following with a holding period ranging between 2 to 21 days which utilise cross asset
	and alternative data. Recently, I have also started an intraday strategy trading hourly. When I was at Systematica, I worked on a cross asset risk premia strategy taking our core carry and trend following strategy and making it delta neutral, working from initial research all the way to implementation. I also worked on alternative delta neutral strategies focusing on FX and equity indices with the goal of expanding to fixed income and commodities.I enjoy doing non-financial research in my own time, I have recently been working on creating interactive visualisation of UK crime data using Python.
	
	My background in studying mathematics at the University of Warwick has equipped me with the necessary tools to problem solve and understand complex ideas. This, combined with extra curricular activities have developed my ability to communicate these ideas clearly. I enjoy leading groups which can be demonstrated through taking supervisions at University for first year students who all passed, informal help sessions and revision lectures. I continued this with excel workshops whilst at Systematica. At NBIM, I have travelled to train and develop our FX trading team in New York and I am currently leading a team with the aim of migrating our applications to the cloud.
	
	Recently I have been working on an internal paper breaking down the inverse of a covariance matrix into meaningful components and deriving their practical impact in calculations such as Markowitz optimisation and linear regression. Part of my current role is to systematise FX execution for the fund and for this, I have written an internal paper on optimisation between market risk and transaction	costs. I present to the management and the CIO regularly to explain the ideas concisely and give updates on implementation.
	
	I am responsible for our code base in the team and have built the backtesting engine from the ground up both in Python and Matlab where I have componentised different parts of the process. This gives flexibility in carrying out investigative research because it allows the ability to easily test multiple hypotheses, analyse different datasets and perform optimisations. It can also be used to put models into production with a small addition to the code. We share our code with other teams and abstract
	out much of the logic, so it can be used across asset classes.
